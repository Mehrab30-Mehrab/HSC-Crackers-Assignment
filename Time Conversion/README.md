This C program converts a given number of days into an equivalent duration expressed in years, months, and days. It assumes:

- 1 year = 365 days
- 1 month = 30 days

This exercise helps in practicing:

- User input handling  
- Arithmetic operations  
- Data conversion  

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
## 🛠️ Compilation

```nginx
gcc -o day_converter day_converter.c
```

## ▶️ Execution

```bash
./day_converter

```

### Output:

```
